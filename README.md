# House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project demonstrates a Machine Learning regression model that predicts house prices based on various housing features. The project was developed using Python in Google Colab.

---

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that estimates house prices using the Boston Housing dataset. The workflow includes data loading, preprocessing, visualization, model training, and evaluation.

This project is part of my Machine Learning practice and portfolio.

## Dataset

The project uses the **Boston House Price dataset**, which contains housing-related features such as:

* Crime rate
* Number of rooms
* Property tax rate
* Accessibility to highways
* etc.

Target variable:

* House Price
